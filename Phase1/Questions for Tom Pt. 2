Questions for Tom Pt. 2:

Tom,

I have another batch of questions for you. I am pretty much done with everything for the project except for the trace logic. That is pretty much what all of my questions are regarding. I am somewhat confused with the document's guidance, especially in the wording. I am having trouble visualizing it. 
Let me know your answers to these questions.

Q1: The document states that for the trace logic that it should show the test "name" and provide a 
    count for the decision in a format that the user will likely understand. Does this mean the 
    overall count of decisions, the current value of the decision count at that point and time within 
    the code, or is it the count for how many times this particular decision has been evaluated?
    
Q2: The document says that each decision point needs a printout of the decision with results. Is 
    this added to the trace logic tab as an entry or is it a single entry that is updated for what 
    the last result of the decision was?

You said that I had a week to complete this on Monday, and I plan on making the most of that timeframe.
I plan on emailing you my .zip file with my solution Monday morning. 
Please be on the lookout for that email. 


Thanks again,
Kennedy
