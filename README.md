# 5FunctionCalculator

## Description
This is a program that creates a 5 Function Calculator written in C++ and using the ImGui GUI Library
under the framework of OpenGLFW. The five functions are addition, subtractions (which is used as both subtraction and denoting a negative number), multiplication, division, and an additive tax calculation (denoted by %).

The program also traces both the inputs by the user as well as the internal logic of the program and the binary decisions that the program makes for analysis and debugging. Also, to assist in the understanding of what is happening under the hood so to speak.

## How to Build
This project was developed on a machine running Linux Ubuntu 22.04, so it is intended for Linux.
ImGui and OpenGLFW have the capability to cross compile, but this has yet to test this at the time of 
writing this document. For the time being, this section will describe the Linux compilation.

### Run the Executable
To run this project, either double click the `5FunctionCalc` file, or open a terminal, navigate to the directry where the executable is located, and execute the following command `./5FunctionCalc`.

### Changing the Code and/or Build the Executable
If you want to edit this file, open the file `/FinalSolutionFiles/src/main.cpp/` file. This is where all of the code is written. All of the other files are to run the ImGui library and to build the executable. Then, when you want to build the project with your newly created changes, run the command `make` to build the project, and then refer to the previous paragraph's instructions to run the executable.

## Methodology / Implementation
This is a project given by VS Merlot for use in analyzing techical skills.
I was given this project on Feb. 12th, 2024 and given a week to complete it.

My approach to the project is shown some within the names of the directories, but I will further expound on them here.
Please see the files to 

### Phase 1: Research


### Phase 2: Logic Implementation

### Phase 3: GUI Visualization

### Phase 4: Logic Trace Finalization

### Phase 5: Documentation (comments, etc.)
